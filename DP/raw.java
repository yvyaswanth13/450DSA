Understanding Coin Change Recursion
When Should You Compare with ?
You should compare with noTake when you have the option to either take or not take a particular coin. This happens when:
1.Each coin can be used multiple times (Unbounded Knapsack Style)
2.Each coin can be used only once (0/1 Knapsack Style)
In both cases, we need to check:
->take: Choosing this coin and reducing the sum.
->noTake: Skipping this coin and moving to the next.

Case 1: Coin Change (Minimum Coins Required)
Problem Statement:
Find the minimum number of coins required to make sum.
âœ… Recurrence Relation
minCoins(i,sum)=min(1+minCoins(i,sumâˆ’coins[i]),minCoins(iâˆ’1,sum));
Why?
->1 + minCoins(i, sum - coins[i]) â†’ Take this coin (if possible).
->minCoins(i-1, sum) â†’ Do not take this coin.
->Compare both to get the minimum number of coins needed.
  
âœ… Java Code
static int minCoinsRecur(int i, int sum, int[] coins) {
    if (sum == 0) return 0;
    if (sum < 0 || i < 0) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // Take the current coin
    int take = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    if (sum >= coins[i]) {
        int res = minCoinsRecur(i, sum - coins[i], coins);
        if (res != Integer.MAX_VALUE) take = 1 + res; // Add 1 only for valid results
    }

    // Don't take the current coin
    int noTake = minCoinsRecur(i - 1, sum, coins);

    return Math.min(take, noTake);
}
âœ” Comparing  ensures we get the minimum.

Case 2: Coin Change (Total Ways to Make Sum)
Problem Statement:
Count the total number of ways to make sum.
  
âœ… Recurrence Relation
ways(i,sum)=ways(i,sumâˆ’coins[i])+ways(iâˆ’1,sum)
Why?
->Add both choices, since we need the total number of ways.
->We do not take the min here.
->ways(i, sum - coins[i]) â†’ Pick this coin and keep using it.
->ways(i-1, sum) â†’ Skip this coin.
  
âœ… Java Code
static int countWays(int i, int sum, int[] coins) {
    if (sum == 0) return 1;
    if (sum < 0 || i < 0) return 0;

    int take = countWays(i, sum - coins[i], coins);
    int noTake = countWays(i - 1, sum, coins);

    return take + noTake; // Total ways to form sum
}
âœ” No  here because we're counting ways, not minimizing.






Key Takeaways
Problem	Base Case ()	Recurrence	Comparison
Minimum Coins	return 0;	min(1 + f(i, sum - coins[i]), f(i-1, sum))	Yes (min())
Total Ways to Make Sum	return 1;	f(i, sum - coins[i]) + f(i-1, sum)	No (+ for total count)

Your Specific Question
"Shouldn't I always use 1 + minCoinsRecur(...) without comparing with noTake?"
Answer: No, because:
1.If we only take coins without comparing with noTake, we might miss the optimal solution.
2.Comparing with noTake ensures we find the minimum.
3.If the problem asks for total ways, we should sum (+), not use min().

Summary
->If minimizing coins, compare take and noTake (min()).
->If counting ways, sum take and noTake (+).
->Don't blindly add  unless you're sure you're counting a valid step.
